# Fieldset
## v0.0.11 (Wed May 31 2023)

"The elements **fieldset** and **legend** are used to group and identify a set of form controls that are related to each other.

Screen readers typically read the content of the legend for each control within a **fieldset**, so its content should be short and descriptive.

**Fieldset** should only be used to group a set of form controls that require a description to enhance **accessibility**, such as a group of radio buttons or checkboxes."
